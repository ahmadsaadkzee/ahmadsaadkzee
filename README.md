I’m Ahmad. I’m a Computer Science Graduate focused on AI and backend development.
I build practical systems using Python, FastAPI, Stable Diffusion, RAG pipelines, and vector databases like ChromaDB.

I’ve worked on generative AI projects for custom clothing design, game development in Unity, and system-level C++ applications. I enjoy solving real problems, optimizing performance, and turning ideas into working products.
